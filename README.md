# Validation of CFD simulations for ship applications

This repository contains a collection of OpenFoam-simulation-case folders that reproduce towing tank experiments from the scientific litterature. The different forlders contains different types of experiments. 

The settings in each simualtion is set based on research into best practices for setting up numerical towing tank simulations. The main intent behind this repository is to show examples of simulation cases for marine applications, and show how the full settings used. 

At the moment, the repository contains examples of straight ahead calm water resistance and drift-induced forces. The goal is to expnad to other examples in the future...
